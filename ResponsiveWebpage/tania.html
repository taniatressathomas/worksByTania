					<p class="firstParagraph">The Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) are located in the United States, along the coast of northern California. Comprising Redwood National Park (established 1968) and California's Del Norte Coast, Jedediah Smith, and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Parks (dating from the 1920s), the combined RNSP contain 133,000 acres (540 km2).[3] Located entirely within Del Norte and Humboldt Counties, the four parks, together, protect 45% of all remaining coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) old-growth forests, totaling at least 38,982 acres (157.75 km2). These trees are the tallest and one of the most massive tree species on Earth. In addition to the redwood forests, the parks preserve other indigenous flora, fauna, grassland prairie, cultural resources, portions of rivers and other streams, and 37 miles (60 km) of pristine coastline.The ecosystem of the RNSP preserves a number of threatened animal species such as the tidewater goby, Chinook salmon, northern spotted owl, and Steller's sea lion.</p>
					<p>The Redwood National Park is much more than tall trees. In this vast parkland of woodlands, rivers and miles of spectacular coastline, visitors can enjoy a wide range of fun outdoor activities. There are several interesting exhibits, guided walks and nature programs on offer at the various visitor centers.</p>

					<h2><a href="#" title="SeaWorld San Diego">#2 SeaWorld San Diego</a></h2>

				</header>
				<div>
					<p class="firstParagraph">Situated in sunny San Diego, SeaWorld is characterized by its theme of marine mammals, daring rides and live shows. Through shows, displays and enclosures people can learn about the worldâ€™s oceans and the creatures that inhabit them such as dolphins, killer whales, walruses, penguins and Polar bears. Rides include a flume roller coaster, rafting through the Shipwreck Rapids and a simulated helicopter ride to experience the Wild Arctic. The main attraction however is the Shamu Show, which involves dancing fountains and talented performances by killer whales.</p>
					<p>SeaWorld was founded in March 21, 1964 by four graduates of the University of California, Los Angeles. Although their original idea of an underwater restaurant was not feasible at the time, the idea was expanded into a 22-acre (8.9 ha) marine zoological park along the shore of Mission Bay in San Diego. After an investment of about $1.5 million, the park opened with 45 employees, several dolphins, sea lions, and two seawater aquariums, and hosted more than 400,000 visitors in its first year of operation.</p>

					<h2><a href="#" title="General Sherman">#1 General Sherman</a></h2>
					<img src="images/sherman.gif" alt="attractions-list" >
				</header>
				<div>
					<p class="firstParagraph">General Sherman is a Giant Sequoia located in the Giant Forest of Sequoia National Park in California. The trees of the Giant Forest are among the largest trees in the world. In fact, if measured by volume, five of the ten largest trees on the planet are located within this forest. With a height of 275 feet the General Sherman tree is the largest of them all. The tree is believed to be between 2,300 and 2,700 years old.</p>
					<p>In February 1978, a four-foot diameter, 140-foot-long (43 m) branch collapsed from the tree.[citation needed] This collapse better revealed its largest branch, which was a little higher on the tree and, curiously, had a similar size, shape and position on the tree (leaving the appearance of the tree relatively unchanged).Computing the volume of a standing tree is the practical equivalent of calculating the volume of an irregular cone. </p>
